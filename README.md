This Django project allows students from various colleges to register for summer technical courses. Students can provide their name, college, and the course they want to attend through a simple HTML form. The registration data is stored in an SQLite database, which can be viewed and managed through the Django admin interface.

To set up the project, first clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt. Next, apply the database migrations with python manage.py makemigrations and python manage.py migrate. Create a superuser for admin access by running python manage.py createsuperuser and following the prompts. Finally, start the development server with python manage.py runserver.

Students can register for courses by accessing the user interface at http://127.0.0.1:8000/app1/ and filling out the registration form. Administrators can log in to the admin interface at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ to view and manage the registrations.

The project structure includes the main Django configuration files and the registration app, which contains models, views, forms, and templates. Contributions to the project are welcome; simply fork the repository, create a new branch, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
